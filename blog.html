								<h3>Dealing with Criticism in Writing</h3>
								<br>Scientific writing is tough for so many reasons. Considering your audience is hard, finding the right narrative flow is hard, putting the 
								first words on the page is<b>super</b> hard. And I was warned about all of this... there are workshops everywhere that seem to want to help me learn to 
								write well and deal with the procrastination cycle associated with writing.
								<br>
								<br>But what I see talked about a lot less is dealing with the part of writing that I find the most difficult.:  when you've finally gotten a first 
								draft on the page and edited it to something that you're proud of and that is ready for others to read and comment on. This part, for me, has historically 
								been the scariest, the most anxiety-inducing, and the part that takes the most energy.  
								<br>
								<br>Learning to deal with this part of writing, which I've come to call the criticism stage, has been a large part of my time and energy in grad school, 
								and if I'm being honest, it continues to be. On top of the <b>amount</b> and <b>difficulty</b> and <b>complexity</b> of work you're doing, you have to deal with scared, 
								vulnerable, and hurt feelings. Whether it was the intention of the person giving comments to hurt your feelings or not, it takes serious mental gymnastics 
								to wire one's brain to understand that criticism is a part of the process, is usually helpful, and at least in my experience, the more comments someone gives,
								 the more they care about the work you're doing. 
								 <br>
								 <br>I think receiving constructive criticism is difficult for a number of reasons. 1) Tone of voice and general sentiment  is often lost over email, which 
								 is usually how one receives said criticism. Every single time I've discussed someone's comments/criticism of my work in person, their voice and social cues 
								 portray much more of a "curious" tone than the demanding tone I perceive in an email. 2) It's not in our academic culture to give positive feedback as much 
								 as I think it should be. I'm lucky here: my advisor and other mentors realize this and make concerted efforts to tell me when I've done something well, and 
								 include saying "great job!" or "well done!" when it's warranted, and especially when including constructive criticism on something I've worked on. But how many 
								 times have you attended a talk, and someone raises their hand, says "I really liked your talk" and then sits down? How many times have you received a random 
								 complement on a paper you wrote with no other content? Again, I think I'm lucky here because I have wonderful collaborators who go out of their way to make 
								 me feel appreciated, but there are all too many cases where this doesn't happen as often as it should. It's just not something we often think of doing, yet 
								 I'd be willing to bet that it's quite common that we have positive thoughts about others' talks and papers. 3) We who love our jobs tend to pour our heart 
								 and soul into our work, and then when we receive criticism, they can come across as more personal than what they really are, which is just... work.
								 <br>
								 <br>I think there are probably lots of other reasons getting comments can be difficult, like the "personal hero" complex that seems to still exist in science, 
								 which breeds feelings of competitiveness and therefore insecurity if you're not doing the <b>literal most exciting thing all by yourself all the time</b>. And what 
								 about the fact that most people writing scientific papers grew up as "gifted kids", where we were praised for our academic achievements? Of course it's going 
								 to be hard to receive criticism on something like this.
								 <br>
								 <br>I have dealt with mental health issues for a long time: I have a panic disorder and  generalized anxiety. So when this part of writing was completely 
								 overwhelming for me, I initially thought that I was alone, and my anxiety was to blame. But  after a few years of practice and talking to friends and mentors, 
								 I realized: everyone deals with this to some extent, and it's seeming to get easier with time. Something that has helped, maybe the most, is hearing that absorbing 
								 criticism is or has been difficult for the people that seem to have tough skin. If dealing with the referee on your manuscript, the devil's advocate on your telescope 
								 proposal, the collaborator skeptical of your methods, is hard for you, and feels more personal than it should: you're not alone.
