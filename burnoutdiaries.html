								<p><b>I've been struggling lately, with my job.</b> I have so much privilege, to have the job I have. 
									I have gotten opportunities I could have never imagined, which led to being able to get a PhD in Physics. 
									Then I got my dream job as an independent research fellow in an institute where, quite literally, some of the best researchers in my field work. 
									When I talk to random people about my job, a common reaction is "wow, you're so lucky, I didn't know you could actually be an astrophysicist". 
								<br><br>But inside, I have felt very sad, stressed, and unmotivated about my job. 
									In academia, much like many other fields or industries, there's a culture of overwork, led by curiosity but also by ego. 
									In "the astrophysics of galaxies" field, people want the most publications, the most distant galaxy to their name. 
									It makes people work incredible hours and expect the same of their colleagues. The problem is worse when, for example, you live in Copenhagen and most 
									collaborators are on the west coast of Canada, making the evenings long and tasks impossible to put down at the end of the day. 
								<br><br>I've been lucky enough to have supportive mentors who encourage a healthy work-life balance, 
									but it's not enough-- the pressure from the field as a whole is too strong. The last few months should have been career-defining
									 for me-- the JWST launched, which makes it so relatively *easy* to publish a paper, because everything we see with that telescope is brand new. 
									 I'm on several large teams where everyone is motivated to help each other publish. And yet, I have totally flopped. I've gotten several emails from 
									 mentors and collaborators asking me when a paper I've written will appear. But my body aches when I open my laptop, and more often than not I start 
									 crying when I try to work on even simple tasks. I struggle to enjoy hobbies I used to wake up excited for. I'm constantly tired and don't make it 
									 through a day without dissociating. 
								<br><br>The reason for this is that over the years, I have chronically taken on too much. Signed up for too much volunteer work, service work, 
									mentoring work, and projects. I've studied and worked harder than many peers to just barely catch up to where they are, been stressed as I 
									passed important tests through grad school, been stressed through first paper publications and postdoc applications, all while dealing with 
									off-the-charts imposter syndrome. From a lifetime of people-pleasing, perfectionism, and having my job and productivity be a very big part of my identity, I've been able to make it to where I thought I wanted to be, but the stress has built up in my body and now I'm paying for it. I know a lot of others who are at different 
									parts of this journey. To the ones who are farther ahead than me and are helping to encourage me through it, thank you. To the ones who are 
									younger and are currently in the "chronically taking on too much" phase-- please take this as a reminder that if you don't take enough real, 
									nourishing breaks, if you don't take care of the stressed, inner child within you as you go, your body will take a break for you. 
								<br><br>I'm taking some time off of work starting next week. It's not the most convenient timing-- I have 2 master's students and there's new JWST data every day. But I don't have a choice.
