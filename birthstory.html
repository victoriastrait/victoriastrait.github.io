								<p> 
									At some point during the process of moving to Denmark, Jordan or I said something like "haha wouldn't it be funny if we had a kid there, we'd get so much parental leave". And somehow, around 2 years in, that pseudo-joke materialized into trying to have an <i>actual</i> baby.
									<br>
									<br>
									My pregnancy was generally wonderful. I had some nausea in the beginning but from the second trimester until maybe a week or two before giving birth I felt great. I loved watching my body change and learning about how the fetus was developing. I loved seeing the ultrasounds-- I cried when we found out Lily was going to be a little girl, because it made the whole thing feel so much more real. I loved feeling her kicks. I didn't love the extra pressure on my bladder, but that might have been the biggest downside. I was luckily able to stay active, hiking and lifting and climbing stayed in my routine until almost the end of the pregnancy. I also loved the care we received. In Denmark, birth stuff is midwife-run unless there is a complication. Other than my GP for the initial pregnancy confirmation appointment, I never saw a doctor during my entire pregnancy. There is generally a pretty laissez faire vibe with respect to pregnancies that seem to be progressing normally here in Denmark. I had maybe 4 midwife appointments and a couple of ultrasound scans. The word for midwife in Danish is "Jordemoder" which translates directly to "Earth Mother", and I thought that nicely mirrored the "let nature happen" feeling I got from this part of the healthcare system. I also have to mention that healthcare in Denmark is socialized, meaning I didn't have to give a second thought about the cost of any of this.
									<br>
									<br>
									I did a lot of birth preparation. As a type-A academic-minded person who struggles to "go with the flow", I approached my fear of giving birth by learning <i>all of the things</i> . I absorbed every blog I could find, pored over birth stories and youtube videos, read any study I could vaguely understand, and I took a hypnobirthing class. I had a list of questions at every midwife appointment. I became a little hyperfocused, but I have to say it helped a lot. I felt fully prepared and never afraid during my birth experience, so learning a lot before giving birth is definitely something I would recommend.
									<br>
									<br>
								
									On Tuesday, October 24th at 11am, 8 days after my due date, I went in to our last midwife appointment, which had been made in case I hadn't gone into labor by then. I got a membrane sweep, which is where the midwife reaches into the vagina and manually separates the cervix from the amniotic sac with her fingers. It was more uncomfortable than I expected, and I actually needed to close my eyes and breathe through it. It was not fun, but the midwife told us there was about a 50% chance of it inducing labor. Jordan and I walked around a bit afterwards and I was pretty much immediately not feeling great. I felt crampy, walking got difficult, had lots of bladder pressure, and was suddenly starving. We walked to the closest burger place we could find and then headed home on the train. Maybe 2-3 hours after getting home I started having contractions that felt stronger than the Braxton-Hicks I had had previously. Nothing painful, nothing I needed to stop what I was doing and breathe through. I could continue to walk and talk, but they were coming at a somewhat regular interval, maybe every 10-20 minutes. I had heard that there could be false alarms so tried not to get too excited, but kind of failed and texted some people anyway.
									<br>
									<br>
									As the day progressed, I did some combination of walking around, bouncing on a yoga ball, and trying to lay down and rest. By the evening, the contractions had slowed to every half hour... and now they were weaker. So I went to bed kind of sad. But around midnight they were stronger again, waking me up, and coming around every 20 minutes or so. I soon needed to breathe through them and started timing them again. They were fairly long, maybe 90 seconds. I got up and down a few times and did eventually make it through to the morning. I spent the rest of the morning doing a puzzle, walking and bouncing. Jordan and I watched an episode of True detective. At this point, I had to stop walking/talking to deal with the contractions. During one of my walks I ran into a neighbor who asked me when I expected the baby and I told her something like "now haha I think I'm in labor isn't that funny".
									<br>
									<br>
									By the afternoon around 1pm the contractions were 4-5 minutes apart and lasting 45 seconds to a minute, so Jordan called the hospital. They told me I could come in and they can check me or I can stay at home for a couple of hours. We stayed at home because we don't have a car and didn't want to have to take a taxi twice. We called again at 3:30, and same answer. We called again at ~4:30 and told them we are now coming into the hospital. It was a very calm decision-- I didn't feel rushed or panicked; it just felt like time. By now I was needing to hold Jordan's hand and vocalize through the contractions. I felt self conscious about doing that at first, so Jordan did it with me for a while. Vocalizing helped. A contraction was lasting about 5-6 long, slow breaths. I was scared of contractions before I gave birth, because everyone I asked described them differently. For me, they started out feeling like painful gas and got more painful from there. But there was a clear rise, peak and decline each time, and the hardest part only lasted a few seconds. In between I felt almost nothing and could fully recover before the next one.
									<br>
									<br>
									We grabbed the car seat and hospital bag (which had been sitting, ready, for almost 2 months at that point. Did I mention I'm a planner?) and had to walk 5-10 minutes until we found a taxi, taking stops to deal with contractions on the sidewalk with a bunch of people walking past. The taxi ride was about 15 minutes and we got there at 5pm. They put us in a holding room which was very... medical feeling--white, sterile. They gave me a warm compress, which didn't do anything for the pain but felt comforting. Jordan figured out how to dim the lights in the room which really helped the vibe. I moved between laying down, sitting on a chair and sitting on the bed during contractions, still needing to vocalize through them, now louder. A midwife checked me and I was 3 centimeters dilated, so not in active labor yet, but they weren't going to send me home, which was a relief. Over the course of the next 5-6 hours I slowly progressed a centimeter at a time. At one point, a midwife suggested an enema and then a walk for 1-2 hours which I eventually said ok to. The enema didn't feel like much except that I had to poop really urgently. 1-2 hours of walking seemed like a lot, and I didn't want to go out into the bright hallway, so I paced around the room and put my arms around Jordans neck while standing for most of the contractions. This did seem to speed things up, as the contractions when I was standing and walking came every 2-3 minutes instead of ~4. I was still coping pretty much fine but was getting a little worried that I wouldn't be able to keep it up for several more hours. Eventually the midwife told me I was 5 centimeters dilated and officially in active labor, and that someone would be by soon to take me to the maternity ward. I remember asking a few times if I can use the tub when I get there and they said yes, definitely, so I was focused on that. I love warm water and had wanted to try to have a water birth.
									<br>
									<br>
									My water broke not long after this and midwife Emily, who took care of me for the rest of the night, had me stand up and she checked the heartbeat of the baby, to make sure the umbilical cord wasn't trapped underneath her head. It was fine, so we slowly made our way to the maternity ward. Walking into the maternity ward itself brought a big sigh of relief. I remember saying "this is so cozy" and smiling and my body relaxing. It was a welcome change from the very sterile-feeling room we had just come from. This room was huge, the lighting was dim, and Emily turned on some ambient piano music. There was a gentle light concept that was peaceful to look at. There was a spa. There were blankets. It was lovely. It must have been around midnight that we got in there because I remember Jordan leaning over to me and telling me "it just turned Lily's birthday." Emily gave us some juice and water, and started filling up the tub while offering some encouragement about how well I was breathing through the contractions. That really helped me because it made me feel like I was doing a good job. Jordan had been telling me that too, but hearing it from someone experienced with birth made me feel even better. It took some time to fill up the tub, so I got in and it really did offer some relief. It felt amazing sitting in there, although it was not trivial to find a perfectly comfortable position where I could lay my head down. I held Jordan's hand and continued vocalizing, probably louder now, and the echo from the tub started to bother me. I remember asking for earplugs to block out the sound of my own voice but immediately throwing them away because it actually made my voice sound louder. At this point I hadn't eaten anything in a long time, so Jordan was trying to feed me, offering gummy bears one at a time.
									<br>
									<br>
								
									I had a feeling of pressure and asked Emily to check me, which she was able to do without me leaving the tub, and I was 6.5 cm dilated. To get through all of these contractions, my main mantra was "the contractions cannot be more powerful than me because they are me". I also focused on the fact that they each came with a rise, peak, decline, and then a break. I could tell they were moving up higher in my uterus, which was kind of nice to feel actually. Progress. A little while later, she told me it would be good to get out of the tub and try to pee. I tried to convince her I was peeing in the tub because I really didn't want to leave (lol) but she wanted me to get out anyway. Later I realized she probably just wanted things to move along faster, and the tub wasn't doing me any favors. Getting out of the tub was the worst. I shivered and contracted and shivered. I was so cold. I made it to the toilet and peed a little, and Emily noticed some bleeding and wanted to check me again to make sure it was just from dilation. Sure enough it was and I was 8cm dilated. At this point, I told Emily that I didn't feel like I was coping very well anymore. She offered gas and air and I said yes. At this point I realized I wasn't getting back in the tub, and I wasn't going to have a water birth. This was the hardest part for me. I felt a lot of pain, I was really exhausted, and I was really ready for it to be over. Jordan also realized we were close, and he reminded me of how close we were to meeting Lily and that it's almost over. Not long after, I felt spontaneous pushing for part of each contraction and my body was letting out a guttural pushing sound. Different from the moaning/yelling I had been doing before, I wasn't controlling this sound. It felt wild. I had no control over what my body was doing anymore. I preferred it to the previous contractions because it felt like real progress.
									<br>
									<br>
									I hated the gas at first, it made me feel claustrophobic and I threw the mouthpiece to the floor. But Emily encouraged me to try again through the entire contraction so I did. I didn't find that it took pain away, but it helped me calm my breathing, so I kept using it. Eventually Emily told me to drop the mask and do a contraction with some active pushing. After some time pushing on my side, I ended up in the classic birthing position where Emily encouraged me to pull my legs back and push with full force 3 big times each contraction. Another midwife came in, and they got worried because my contractions were kind of far apart, so they put a CTG on me to measure Lily's heart rate, which ended up being fine. They were amazed actually at how fine she was. She crowned for a long time, maybe half an hour. I eventually felt the midwives doing things with their fingers, pushing my perineum out of the way and maybe stretching the labia and applying numbing gel. I remember feeling Lily's head come out a bit more and then go back in. The pushing was exhausting. I was giving everything I had and then a little more with each push. I said out loud at some point that I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. I felt so sweaty, and I was basically asleep between contractions. A few pushes later and I felt some tearing happen/the ring of fire feeling people describe, and Lily's head was halfway out. Unfortunately it was stuck there for another contraction, which I hated, but at this point I was breathing the gas in between contractions to stay calm. I had really feared the crowning part before giving birth, but in hindsight it was very fleeting. One last push with gasping breaths and her head was born.
									<br>
									<br>
									I felt them kind of pull the rest of her body out, and then put her on my chest. She was crying loudly immediately. I immediately recognized her movements from inside now outside of me. That was 5:21 am. The active pushing was about an hour and a half in total. I looked at Jordan and said "what" and started shivering, so the midwives put some blankets on me and relaxed. Jordan then hand fed me some Doritos, which made everyone laugh. I definitely felt the delivery of the placenta but it was nothing compared to the baby. I hated the fundal massage which felt like someone was literally punching me in the stomach because they kind of are. The midwives showed us the placenta and amniotic sac, and how Lily was oriented laying in there. Stitching didn't feel too bad-- I ended up with some minor tears on my labia but none on my perineum, likely because she crowned for so long. Jordan and I both sat there and looked at her in awe for at least an hour and eventually stitching was done and Jordan got to hold her. We both cried. I don't have words to describe how amazing it felt to finally meet the creature that my body had grown inside of my for the majority of a year, which felt like a hypothetical until then there she was. A new human being.
									<br>
									<br>
									I was able to get up and walk to the bathroom to pee by myself but did feel a little dizzy at first. It stung but not as bad as I expected. Jordan and I remained in that room for another couple of hours until someone eventually came and weighed and measured Lily. Then a nice man took us away on a roll-away bed. We put a light green leaf of the hospital's "tree of life" because we had had a healthy baby girl, and went to the maternity ward where we were met with some of the most caring and helpful nurses, midwives and students that I have ever met. Each time they came in they offered a tip about breastfeeding, they checked on me, they were empathetic and caring. I think I cried almost every time someone left the room I was so grateful. Jordan and I didn't sleep much those 2 nights, but we got through it. After 48 hours in the hospital we came home, in another taxi this time with the carseat occupied, where the most amazing chaos began.
