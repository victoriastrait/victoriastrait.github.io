								<h3>Inclusion</h3>
								<p><b>First generation students</b>
								<br>As a first generation college and graduate student, I understand the importance of having help with the various 
								application processes that higher education requires. I volunteer to read college and grad school applications and 
								discuss my experiences with high school and college students. If you need help with an application, please feel free
								to contact me.</p>
								<p><b>Cultivating a welcoming culture in physics and astronomy through workshops and resource-sharing</b>
								<br>As a member of the <a href="https://davisdip.wordpress.com/">Diversity in Physics</a> (DIP) 
								group, I strive to make everyone around me feel welcome and included. As a group, we have been active in improving 
								the department culture at UC Davis, through helping design and implement workshops focused on applying to graduate school, 
								imposter syndrome, and mentoring. Additionally, we compile and share resources for various circumstances that come up in grad school, 
								such as finding an advisor, mentoring and being a mentor, dealing with harassment, and much more.  
								</p>

								<h3>Diversity</h3>
								<p><b>Antiracism in Physics and Astronomy Departments</b>
								<br>In addition to inclusivity, I care deeply about diversity in Physics and Astronomy. Among the resources
								DIP has compiled are those focused on confronting whiteness in academia, becoming a better antriracist, and
								actionable items to change racist policy and ideas. I started a reading group in the department focused on antriracist reading material, 
								and have been advocating strongly for antiracist policy and practices in hiring and testing in Physics and Astronomy. Find 
								resources on the <a href="https://davisdip.wordpress.com/">DIP</a> website or contact me. </p>

								<h3>Outreach</h3>
								<b>Elementary and Middle School Events</b>
								<br>I participate in elementary school aged-centric outreach events in Davis and do various other kid-friendly 
								outreach such as "Zoom a Scientist" and classroom visits. At past events, I've set up solar telescopes, done demonstrations of gravitational 
								lensing, made comets out of household materials, and of course, made <a href="https://www.noao.edu/education/crecipe.html">liquid 
								nitrogen ice cream</a>.

								<p><b>Astronomy on Tap</b>
								<br>I started a branch of <a href="https://astronomyontap.org/">Astronomy on Tap</a> in Davis with UCD 
								<a href="https://stefanovalenti.weebly.com/">Professor Stefano Valenti</a>. AoT is a monthly series of 
								public talks at a brewery. More information about events is on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AoT.Davis/">Facebook</a> 
								and <a href="https://twitter.com/AoTDavis">Twitter</a> pages.

								<!--<p><b>Capital Science Communicators</b>
								<br>I am involved with Capital Science Communicators (CapSciComm), a local science communication group that advocates for 
							science writers, science policy, and outreach efforts in the Sacramento Region. </p>-->
